            In order to understand encryption, a good place to start is with more simple forms of encryption.
            An especially simple form of encryption is the "Caesar Cipher", which shifts the alphabet by a number of
            places.

        <p class="header-description">
            But before we get into the meat and potatoes of how the Ceasarian Shift works, let's start by looking at why encrypting our data is important.
            Then continue by figuring out just how to do our first form of message encryption.
