## About the Project
We have developed an interactive, hands-on, challenge-based learning software to educate students on cybersecurity principles. The web-based software emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA), along with their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. Through these hands-on activities, non-major college students, high school teachers, and K-12 students will learn how to identify cyber threats and protect themselves against these threats by applying their newfound understanding of the CIA Triad, gaining a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles applicable to personal browsing and workplace environments, while empowering them to become informed and responsible digital citizens. Moreover, the software promotes adversarial thinking, problem-solving, and critical analysis skills among early learners and contributes to the progress of cybersecurity education and helps secure public awareness of cybersecurity issues while preparing the next generation of STEM scientists and engineers.
